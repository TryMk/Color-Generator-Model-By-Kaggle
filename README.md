# Color Generator Model

This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning model designed to generate color names based on a dataset from Kaggle.

## Project Overview

The Color Generator Model leverages a deep learning approach using TensorFlow and Keras to predict color names based on RGB values. This model was trained on a dataset of color names, and the aim is to generate a model that can predict color names accurately.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation was sourced from Kaggle, containing a collection of color names and their corresponding RGB values. 

## Model Architecture

The model uses a sequential neural network architecture that includes the following layers:
- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
- Dense layers
- Dropout layers for regularization

## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need the following libraries:
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas

You can install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy pandas
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/color-generator-model.git
cd color-generator-model
```

2. **Prepare the data:**

Ensure that the `colors_kaggle.csv` dataset is available in the project directory. 

3. **Run the notebook:**

You can execute the Jupyter Notebook to train the model:

```bash
jupyter notebook "Color Generator Model by Kaggle.ipynb"
```

4. **Model Evaluation:**

After training, you can evaluate the model's performance using the test data provided in the notebook.

## Results

The model is designed to predict color names with a high degree of accuracy. You can visualize the predictions and the accuracy metrics within the notebook.
